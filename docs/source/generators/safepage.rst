**SafePage Generator**
======================

Overview
--------

| This tool is a basic generator of simple multi-page news blogs based on templates and a content module developed by our team. You are offered to choose the content theme from a precompiled list. You can also select the language for automatic translation of the text you need.
| The generated content is randomized based on a modular database consisting of hundreds of different options, and the resulting pages successfully pass moderation on all major advertising networks.
