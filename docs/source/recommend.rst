Recommendations
===============

General recommendations for working with our tools, which are universal for most of our users. We strongly recommend following them to achieve the best results with Comsign.

Working with generators
-----------------------

1. **Always use** a theme or a link to the app that is most relevant to the subject of your ads creative.

2. **Always use** keywords when generating safe pages. They will increase the uniqueness of the safe page itself and link it to your ads creative, which will positively affect the moderation process.

3. **Always use** keywords when generating safe pages. Specified domain name will increase the uniqueness of the safe page itself and increase the quality of the whole ads campaign, which will positively affect the moderation process.

4. **Do not use** the same safe pages multiple times, whether in different advertising campaigns or in different advertising networks. Despite the high quality of our safe pages, they are single-use, so if you have used a safe page somewhere before, repeated use is not recommended.

5. **Always check** the generated safe page from WordPress generator for questionable, prohibited, or stop-words. Although we regularly monitor the quality of the content used, due to the nature of current events in the world, such words sometimes appear, so be vigilant.

6. **Always check** the generated safe page from WordPress generator for images that contain prohibited or questionable material. Although we regularly monitor the quality of the content used, due to the nature of current events in the world, such images sometimes appear, so be vigilant.

Choosing a domain name and hosting
----------------------------------

1. **Do not use** domain names in cheap zones, such as .site, .club, .world, etc., because they attract increased attention from moderators as well as antivirus and scoring companies. In fact, such domain names are at risk from the moment they are registered. Use only domain zones like .org, .net, and .com, in order of preference.

2. **Do not use** domain names that contain questionable or stop-words. Use your imagination to come up with domain names that look and sound like brands.

3. **Always use** Cloudflare to hide the IP addresses of your servers. Many advertising networks remember the IP addresses of domains in blocked accounts, but they will never ban the IP addresses of one of the largest CDN companies that serves 10% of the entire Internet.

4. **Do not use** technical domains of hosting companies. They look suspicious and uniquely identify individual servers.

5. **Always configure** HTTPS for your pages. Cloudflare provides free SSL/TLS certificates for domain names in proxy mode. Letâ€™s Encrypt also provides infrastructure for managing free SSL/TLS certificates.

6. **It is recommended** to use hosting in close proximity to the target audience, ideally in the same country. This is especially important when working with the popunder format.

 Be aware that the success of moderation of your advertising campaign depends not only on these recommendations.
