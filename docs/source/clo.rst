Adspect cloaking
================

Overview
--------

One of the undeniable advantages of Comsign tools has been and remains the collaboration with Adspect – a cloud service designed to protect online advertising campaigns from unwanted traffic. Thanks to this collaboration, not only can you use a single account in both interfaces, but it also allows you to reduce the entire process of cloaking integration with the generated page to a couple of clicks, following our main concept - extremely simple and extremely effective. All our generators are capable of automatically integrating the stream into the generated pages.

The workflow is as follows:

1. Create a stream, specifying the action "No action" in the safe page settings.

2. Skip the page with integration instructions.

3. In the generator, select the stream for integration from the list and click the "Generate" button.

4. If the result suits you – click the "Download" button to get a ZIP archive with the already integrated cloak. Then you just need to "unpack" the archive and place it on your server.
